  description: "His main research interests are in the field of Geographical Information Systems and spatial data integration, with particular focus on semantic 3D city modelling and their energy-related topics.
  Some of his research topics deal for example with the development of an information model to manage and exchange semantically-enriched multi-resolution 3D data for urban energy planning.
  Having a semantic 3D virtual city model as background, the idea is to foster software integration to allow complex urban system simulation and close (or reduce) the gap between geo-information and simulation.
  He is currently chair of the [ISPRS Technical Commission 4 WG 10 (Advanced Geospatial Applications for Smart Cities and Regions)](http://www2.isprs.org/commissions/comm4/wg10.html) and national representative for Austria of the Urban Data Management Society (UDMS)."

  description: "I am a postdoc researcher in the [3D geoinformation group](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/) at the Delft University of Technology, and a research fellow of the [Amsterdam Institute for Advanced Metropolitan Solutions (AMS)](https://www.ams-institute.org/member/francesca-noardo/).
I work towards the integration of multi-source data in particular, detailed 3D models (from survey or from design) in interoperable 3D maps, having semantics (meaning and descriptions) from open standards and correct geometry. The inclusion of different levels-of-detail, time, extra information (energy, history, functions, sensor data…) make such maps increasingly powerful to analyse the city (e.g. noise, air quality, urban flooding), visualise effects of changes, communicate, educate.
I envisage the concrete employment of such technology for smart cities applications.


I am now working in projects aiming at the integration of 3D geoinformation with Building Information Models (BIM).


I had my MSc in Architecture (Restoration and Enhancement) from the Politecnico di Torino (Italy) (2012), where I also obtained my PhD in Cultural Heritage (2016), during which (and until may 2018) my research was especially directed at the use of open standard data models and open technologies to archive high-level-of-detail and semantic information in 3D digital maps.


I am the secretary in the [Working Group IV/2](http://www2.isprs.org/commissions/comm4/wg2.html): Ontologies, Semantics, and Knowledge Representation for Geospatial Information of the International Society of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS).

  description: "I am a full professor in Spatial Data Infrastructure, at the Faculty of Architecture and The Built Environment and I am leading the [3D GeoInformation](http://3d.bk.tudelft.nl) group at the Department of [Urbanism](http://www.bk.tudelft.nl/en/about-faculty/departments/urbanism/).
  I obtained my PhD degree ([3D Cadastre](http://www.itc.nl/library/Papers_2004/phd/stoter.pdf)) in 2004.
  For this work I received the Tienstra award.
  After my PhD I worked several years at ITC, University of Twente (2004-2009) and led there a research group on “automated generalisation”.
  I combine my professorship with jobs as researcher at both the [Kadaster](http://www.kadaster.nl/web/english.htm) and [Geonovum](http://www.geonovum.nl).
  I am chair of the [EuroSDR](www.eurosdr.net) 3D Special Interest Group [EuroSDR 3D SIG](http://www.eurosdr.net/research/project/eurosdr-special-interest-group-3d-3d-sig).
  Since March 2015, I am vice-chair of the Open Geospatial COnsortium 3D Information Management Domain Working Group [(OGC 3DIM DWG)](http://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/groups/3dimdwg).
  In December 2016, I became a Principal Investigator at the [Amsterdam Institute of Advanced Metropolitan Solutions](http://www.ams-amsterdam.com)

  My research interests are 3D, automated generalization and information modelling.
  For my research on [5D data modelling](http://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/projects/geo5d/) I received the prestigious Vidi award of the Netherlands Scientific Foundation ([NWO](http://www.nwo.nl/en/research-and-results/programmes/Talent+Scheme/awards/vidi+awards/vidi+awards+2010)).
  In addition I received a Starting Grant from the European Research Council for my proposal Urban Modelling in higher dimensions ([ERC](https://erc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document/file/erc_2015_stg_results_all_domains.pdf)).
  I am (co)author of over 350 academic and professional articles and appeared several times in regional and national media.
  I am a member of the editorial boards of several journals: [CEUS](http://www.journals.elsevier.com/computers-environment-and-urban-systems/), the [Geography Journal](http://www.hindawi.com/journals/geography/) and the [International Journal of 3D Information Modelling](http://www.irma-international.org/journal/international-journal-information-modeling-ij3dim/41967/)"
