  description: "I am an early stage researcher specializing in geographic data science and GIS. 
  I am currently splitting my time between the 3D Geoinformation research group at TU Delft, the [Senseable City Lab](https://senseable.mit.edu/) at MIT and the [Amsterdam Institute for Advanced Metropolitan Solutions (AMS)](https://www.ams-institute.org/). 
  My PhD research focuses on scalable solutions for urban climate change adaptation and is anchored in the broader themes of climate resilience, remote sensing, and assessments of urban morphology.<br/><br/>
  
  My current work explores the role of shade in mitigating urban heat stress. 
  Urban heat is a growing challenge as cities warm faster than rural areas, often surpassing the 1.5°C goal of the Paris Climate Accords. 
  Traditional strategies may not fully address this, so urban planners must explore alternatives like shading, which can effectively reduce Mean Radiant Temperature (MRT), a key factor in outdoor thermal comfort. 
  While planners and designers can’t control all climate variables, they can influence shading through urban design, which is under-researched for large cities. 
  My PhD project aims to measure shade at scale, assess the impact of buildings and trees, and evaluate how well cities provide shade where it’s most needed.<br/><br/>

  In addition to my interest in shade, I am also investigating the role of additional data sources, such as remote sensing and mobile sensing platforms, in improving the availability and coverage of urban climate data."

  Before joining TU Delft, I was research engineer at the [Masdar Institute of Science and Technology](https://www.ku.ac.ae/institute/masdar-institute) in Abu Dhabi (United Arab Emirates).

  After receiving my Ph.D., I worked as postdoctoral research scholar at the [Berkeley Education Alliance for Research in Singapore](https://bears.berkeley.edu/) under the SinBerBEST 2 Theme D project.<br/><br/>

  The Marie Curie action is a three-year project called Smart City Innovations and Experiments using New Climate and Energy Simulations (SCIENCES) and supervised by [Prof. Jantien Stoter](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/jstoter/), [Assist. Prof. Clara Garcia-Sanchez](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/gsclara), and [Prof. Mario Berges](https://www.cmu.edu/cee/people/faculty/berges.html). 
  In this project, I am looking for solutions to (1) improve simulations of air pollutants in urban areas, (2) co-simulate statistical and physically-based urban microclimate models, and (3) generate physically-based models from 3D city models and Internet-of-Things.
  Based on these solutions, it is aimed at proving that physically-based urban microclimate models could easily be integrated into digital twin platforms for the development of climate-neutral and smart cities."
