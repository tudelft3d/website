  description: "Maria Valese is PhD Candidate at the Chair of Heritage and Values in the Department of AE+T in the Faculty of Architecture and Built Environments and 3D Geoinformation group at TU Delft. She studied Sciences of Architecture at the Politecnico di Torino and gained her MA in Architecture UE at La Sapienza - Università di Roma with a thesis on environmental, energetic and architectural renovation of an Italian historical village located in the Unesco Cilento Geopark, focusing on the use of GIS tool in planning. She has worked as GIS consultant and took part in several international and multidisciplinary projects focused on mapping urban phenomena and socio-cultural investigation. Her doctoral research investigates the use of geomatics tools and methods to analyse the relation between conservation areas and the development trends of connected human settlements, focusing on innovative earth observatory technologies and automatic modelling tools, within the [HERILAND](https://www.heriland.eu) project."

  description: "His main research interests are in the field of Geographical Information Systems and spatial data integration, with particular focus on semantic 3D city modelling and their energy-related topics.
  Some of his research topics deal for example with the development of an information model to manage and exchange semantically-enriched multi-resolution 3D data for urban energy planning.
  Having a semantic 3D virtual city model as background, the idea is to foster software integration to allow complex urban system simulation and close (or reduce) the gap between geo-information and simulation.
  He is currently chair of the [ISPRS Technical Commission 4 WG 10 (Advanced Geospatial Applications for Smart Cities and Regions)](http://www2.isprs.org/commissions/comm4/wg10.html) and national representative for Austria of the Urban Data Management Society (UDMS)."

  description: "I am a full professor in Spatial Data Infrastructure, at the Faculty of Architecture and The Built Environment and I am leading the [3D GeoInformation](http://3d.bk.tudelft.nl) group at the Department of [Urbanism](http://www.bk.tudelft.nl/en/about-faculty/departments/urbanism/).
  I obtained my PhD degree ([3D Cadastre](http://www.itc.nl/library/Papers_2004/phd/stoter.pdf)) in 2004.
  For this work I received the Tienstra award.
  After my PhD I worked several years at ITC, University of Twente (2004-2009) and led there a research group on “automated generalisation”.
  I combine my professorship with jobs as researcher at both the [Kadaster](http://www.kadaster.nl/web/english.htm) and [Geonovum](http://www.geonovum.nl).
  I am chair of the [EuroSDR](www.eurosdr.net) 3D Special Interest Group [EuroSDR 3D SIG](http://www.eurosdr.net/research/project/eurosdr-special-interest-group-3d-3d-sig).
  Since March 2015, I am vice-chair of the Open Geospatial COnsortium 3D Information Management Domain Working Group [(OGC 3DIM DWG)](http://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/groups/3dimdwg).
  In December 2016, I became a Principal Investigator at the [Amsterdam Institute of Advanced Metropolitan Solutions](http://www.ams-amsterdam.com)

  My research interests are 3D, automated generalization and information modelling.
  For my research on [5D data modelling](http://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/projects/geo5d/) I received the prestigious Vidi award of the Netherlands Scientific Foundation ([NWO](http://www.nwo.nl/en/research-and-results/programmes/Talent+Scheme/awards/vidi+awards/vidi+awards+2010)).
  In addition I received a Starting Grant from the European Research Council for my proposal Urban Modelling in higher dimensions ([ERC](https://erc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document/file/erc_2015_stg_results_all_domains.pdf)).
  I am (co)author of over 350 academic and professional articles and appeared several times in regional and national media.
  I am a member of the editorial boards of several journals: [CEUS](http://www.journals.elsevier.com/computers-environment-and-urban-systems/), the [Geography Journal](http://www.hindawi.com/journals/geography/) and the [International Journal of 3D Information Modelling](http://www.irma-international.org/journal/international-journal-information-modeling-ij3dim/41967/)"
