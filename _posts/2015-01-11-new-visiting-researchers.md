We are happy to welcome two visiting researchers to our group. Elif Demir Özbek and Serpil Ates are research assistants and PhD candidates at the Department of Geomatics Engineering at Istanbul Technical University, holding degrees in Geomatics from the same university.

The topic of **Elif**'s PhD thesis is "Development and Implementation of Interoperability Principles for Turkey Disaster Management System". The aim of her stay at TU Delft is to improve the 3D data model approach for emergency response at the provincial level in Turkey.

**Serpil**'s PhD research deals with establishing a building reference model for 3D geo-information in Turkey by integrating the existing 2D geo-data standard TRKBIS (UrbanGIS) with CityGML. During her stay at TU Delft, Serpil will focus on developing an application domain extension of CityGML in UML. Serpil and Elif will stay at our group for one year.
