Yanning Qiu has recently joined our research group as a Postdoctoral Researcher. She will be working on the development of an AI-powered smart sensing and monitoring system to better understand the dynamics of urban waste in Amsterdam, as part of the Schone Binnenstad project funded by the AMS Institute.


Before joining our group, Yanning completed her PhD and a postdoctoral position at Wageningen University & Research. Her PhD research combined field monitoring, remote sensing, and mathematical modelling to evaluate the long-term ecological outcomes of dryland restoration projects from a resilience perspective. During her postdoctoral research, she applied AI-assisted literature analysis and statistical modelling to quantify and characterize micro- and nanoplastics (MNPs) in both the environment and the human body, with the aim of supporting microplastic health risk assessment.


Welcome, Yanning!
