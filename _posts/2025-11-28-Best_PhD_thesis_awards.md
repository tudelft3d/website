We are delighted to announce that our colleague, [Dr. Weixiao Gao](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/weixiao/), has been doubly honored for his outstanding PhD research. He has been named a joint winner of the [2025 EuroSDR PhD Award](https://www.eurosdr.net/news/eurosdr-announces-joint-winners-2025-phd-award) and the sole winner of the [2025 EAASI Outstanding Thesis Award](https://www.eaasi.eu/post/eaasi-announces-winner-of-the-2025-outstanding-thesis-award-weixiao-gao-delft-university-of-techno). This remarkable dual recognition highlights the exceptional scientific merit and significant practical impact of his work, bridging the gap between cutting-edge academic research and real-world industrial applications in geomatics.

Dr. Gao's thesis, ["Semantic Understanding of Urban Scenes from Textured Meshes"](https://doi.org/10.4233/uuid:75ffb577-05a6-465f-8d71-92fb3e3f960c), tackles core challenges in modern 3D geoinformation. His research establishes a foundational pipeline for interpreting complex urban textured meshes—derived from aerial imagery—by creating benchmark datasets, developing efficient interactive annotation tools, and introducing novel deep learning algorithms. The core outcome is an automated framework for generating lightweight, semantically rich 3D city models (LoD3), which directly translates to improved efficiency and reduced costs in digital city reconstruction for the wider geospatial industry.
