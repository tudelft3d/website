On November 19th, 2024, [Pakhuis de Zwijger](https://dezwijger.nl/programma/hoe-ai-de-architectuur-verandert) hosted a discussion on ‘How AI is transforming architecture’ in Amsterdam. The event brought together experts from various backgrounds to share insights on the impacts of AI on architecture. [Amy Sterrenberg](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/asterrenberg/), a PhD researcher at the 3D Geoinformation research group, shared perspectives grounded in both research and practice. A key message was the need for balance—embracing AI’s capabilities while ensuring its adoption is ethical and transparent.
