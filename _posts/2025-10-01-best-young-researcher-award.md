Several members of our group participated at the joint conference **20th 3DGeoinfo and 9th Smart Data and Smart Cities**, which was held by the Center of Spatial Information Science of the University of Tokyo. We present the following publications within the joint conference:

- [Enriching LoD2 Building Models with Facade Openings Using Oblique Imagery](https://isprs-annals.copernicus.org/articles/X-4-W6-2025/225/2025/)
- [RoofSense: A Multimodal Semantic Segmentation Dataset for Roofing Material Classification](https://isprs-annals.copernicus.org/articles/X-4-W6-2025/153/2025/)
- [FlatCityBuf: a new cloud-optimised CityJSON format](https://isprs-archives.copernicus.org/articles/XLVIII-4-W15-2025/17/2025/)
- [Semantic segmentation of point clouds with the 3D medial axis transform](https://isprs-annals.copernicus.org/articles/X-4-W6-2025/33/2025/)
- [A proposal to update and enhance the CityGML Energy Application Domain Extension](https://isprs-annals.copernicus.org/articles/X-4-W6-2025/1/2025/)
- [Lessons learnt from the integration of open data and semantic 3D city models for urban building energy modelling in the Netherlands](https://isprs-annals.copernicus.org/articles/X-4-W7-2025/89/2025/)
- [Data-Driven Energy Simulations To Evaluate Positive Energy District Potential in Rotterdam](https://isprs-annals.copernicus.org/articles/X-4-W7-2025/25/2025/)
- [Introducing server-side support for 3DCityDB 5.0 to the 3DCityDB-Tools plug-in for QGIS](https://isprs-annals.copernicus.org/articles/X-4-W6-2025/193/2025/)


We are happy that our colleague **Camilo León-Sánchez** won the Best Young Researcher Award at the 9th Smart Data Smart Cities conference for his paper 'Lessons learnt from the integration of open data and semantic 3D city models for urban building energy modelling in the Netherlands’.

This publication shares the lessons learnt from the integration of open datasets in the Netherlands for the creation of a country-wide enriched semantic 3D city model for urban building energy modelling. Congratulations to Camilo and his coauthors.
