On September 2-5 2025, our research group participated in the joint conference of **the 20th International 3D GeoInfo and the 9th International Smart Data and Smart Cities** hosted by the Center of Spatial Information Science at the University of Tokyo.

We presented eight publications covering diverse aspects of 3D geoinformation:


- [Enriching LoD2 Building Models with Facade Openings Using Oblique Imagery](https://isprs-annals.copernicus.org/articles/X-4-W6-2025/225/2025/)
- [RoofSense: A Multimodal Semantic Segmentation Dataset for Roofing Material Classification](https://isprs-annals.copernicus.org/articles/X-4-W6-2025/153/2025/)
- [FlatCityBuf: a new cloud-optimised CityJSON format](https://isprs-archives.copernicus.org/articles/XLVIII-4-W15-2025/17/2025/)
- [Semantic segmentation of point clouds with the 3D medial axis transform](https://isprs-annals.copernicus.org/articles/X-4-W6-2025/33/2025/)
- [A proposal to update and enhance the CityGML Energy Application Domain Extension](https://isprs-annals.copernicus.org/articles/X-4-W6-2025/1/2025/)
- [Lessons learnt from the integration of open data and semantic 3D city models for urban building energy modelling in the Netherlands](https://isprs-annals.copernicus.org/articles/X-4-W7-2025/89/2025/)
- [Data-Driven Energy Simulations To Evaluate Positive Energy District Potential in Rotterdam](https://isprs-annals.copernicus.org/articles/X-4-W7-2025/25/2025/)
- [Introducing server-side support for 3DCityDB 5.0 to the 3DCityDB-Tools plug-in for QGIS](https://isprs-annals.copernicus.org/articles/X-4-W6-2025/193/2025/)

Additionally, our colleague **Clara García-Sánchez** delivered a keynote speech sharing insights on advancing 3D modeling techniques for with a focus on urban flow simulations.

Finally, we are proud to announce that our colleague **Camilo León-Sánchez** won the **Best Young Researcher Award** at the 9th Smart Data Smart Cities conference for his paper *"Lessons learnt from the integration of open data and semantic 3D city models for urban building energy modelling in the Netherlands"*.

This publication presents valuable insights from the integration of open datasets in the Netherlands for the creation of a country-wide enriched semantic 3D city model for urban building energy modelling. 

Congratulations to Camilo and his co-authors!
