Inés joins us as a PhD researcher and Junior Lecturer. Her research focuses on the long-term transformation of train station areas and the role of pedestrian movement patterns in shaping these transformations. She works at the fascinating intersection of time and space!

Hiba is our new PhD researcher whose work will be part of the recently awarded **RenoDAT project**. Her research focuses on 3D geoinformation for building renovation passports and energy transition.


Welcome to the team, Hiba and Inés! We look forward to working with you!
