On Monday, November 4, 2024, [Weixiao Gao](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/weixiao/) successfully defended his PhD thesis at TU Delft.

His dissertation, entitled *Semantic understanding of urban scenes from textured meshes*, is freely available for download([PDF](https://doi.org/10.4233/uuid:75ffb577-05a6-465f-8d71-92fb3e3f960c)).

We are also excited that Weixiao will continue to work with the group as a Postdoc!

Congratulations, Dr. Gao ðŸŽ‰
