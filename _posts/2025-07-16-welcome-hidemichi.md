Hidemichi has recently joined our research group as a PhD candidate. He brings a strong academic and professional foundation that combines expertise in **web technologies** and **project management** with a focused research interest in **computational geometry**, **3D city modelling**, and **cloud GIS**. His professional experience has equipped him with practical skills in web development and leading collaborative projects across teams and organizations.

In his Master's thesis, Hidemichi developed a **FlatCityBuf, a cloud-optimized data format for CityJSON**, enabling efficient partial access to large datasets through spatial indexing, attribute indexing, and HTTP range requests. For his PhD research, he will focus on methodologies for **3D city model reconstruction** using heterogeneous datasets and on developing environments that facilitate the integration and use of reconstructed models in real-world applications.

Welcome, Hidemichi!
