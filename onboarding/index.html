  <h1 class="purple-header">Welcome to 3D geoinformation group!</h1>

  <p>So, you recently joined our group! The first days can be a little overwhelming, so we put together a TODO list to ease the process:</p>

  <h3 class="purple-header">ACCESS</h3>
  <p>Get a NetID + CampusCard (our secretaries Margo or Martine will arrange this for you).</p>

  <h3 class="purple-header">COMMUNICATION</h3>
  <p>Download <a href="https://telegram.org/">Telegram</a> (if you don't already have it) and ask anyone in the group to add you to our group chat. It's also helpful if you have a global username so that it's easier to add you to group chats. This is our main communication channel as a group (even though other people in TU Delft are using Teams). You can find your colleagues through the member list of our main channel (3DGeoInfo). Please check your messages regularly!</p>

  <h3 class="purple-header">DESK</h3>
  <p>Do you already know where to sit? If not, <a href="https://tud365-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/amysterrenberg_tudelft_nl/EZ0W5DvhjFROpnpIwRkrnpwBJyaH9j9zHHRbYBhEzC9Qlg?e=i481pM">check here</a> to see if a desk has been assigned to you. If not, ask Amy.</p>

  <h3 class="purple-header">GITHUB</h3>
  <p>Gina or your supervisor can give you access <a href="https://github.com/tudelft3d">to the repos of our organization</a>. Make sure you accept the invitation when you receive it. You will need access to the GitHub organization for various steps below.</p>

  <h3 class="purple-header">WEBSITE</h3>
  <p>When you have time, you should update <a href="https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/about/#people">our website</a> with your info on the 'staff' page.</p>

  <p>You will need to clone <a href="https://github.com/tudelft3d/website">the website repository</a>, follow the instructions and update the <em>_data/staff.yml</em> file (or the <em>_data/staff_visiting.yml</em> file if you are visiting). The website gets updated automatically (after a few minutes) when you push your changes to the 'main' branch.</p>

  <p>You will need the following information:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Full name</li>
    <li>Email</li>
    <li>Position/title</li>
    <li>Institute/University (if you are visiting)</li>
    <li>A square photo of 200X200px (This is important because we need to keep the size of the repo small)</li>
    <li>A one-line description of your main project</li>
    <li>A lengthier description of your research and background for your webpage (if you already have a webpage and you need to host it, it can also be done)</li>
    <li>Link to website/LinkedIn</li>
  </ul>

  <p>It would also be nice if you could write a short welcoming post for yourself (not necessary for academic visitors). Please have a look at previous posts for some inspiration.</p>

  <p>If you do not have time or if you have any difficulties with this, Gina can help you!</p>

  <h3 class="purple-header">MAILING LIST</h3>
  <p>Subscribe to <a href="https://listserv.tudelft.nl/mailman/listinfo/3dgeoinfo-bk">our group's mailing list</a>. With it, you'll receive all important emails and invites. You can also email everyone in the group at <code>3dgeoinfo-bk@lists.tudelft.nl</code>. <em>Please make sure that your supervisor sends you invitations to any upcoming but earlier-organised group events and meetings.</em></p>

  <h3 class="purple-header">WORKING REMOTELY</h3>
  <p>Set up your <a href="https://vpn.tudelft.nl/">TU Delft VPN</a> for working off campus. The instruction manual for the configuration can be found <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/ict-handleidingen/vpn">here</a>.</p>

  <h3 class="purple-header">3DTEA</h3>
  <p>In the 3D geoinformation group we have a casual weekly meeting which we call 3DTea. This happens <strong>every Thursday at 16:00</strong> and people can attend either online or in person. This time is usually used for short presentations about recent work/research, or about other matters that might interest us. As a newcomer, you will use one of the 3DTeas to introduce yourself and talk about the work you will be doing in the group. Most importantly, you need to include information about <strong>your favourite dish, favourite music, and favourite book/movie/series etc.</strong> <a href="https://tud365.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/3DTea-UDS/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B337C5919-4BDB-4132-8852-E0E1543001FF%7D&file=3DTea%40UDS.xlsx&action=default&mobileredirect=true">Please see the available dates here</a> or ask Amy.</p>

  <h3 class="purple-header">WEEKLY UPDATES</h3>
  <p>Every Monday you will receive a reminder on the 3DGeoInfo channel on Telegram (from our bot, Wynn) to update the rest of the group on what you are working on this week. You should go to 'issues' in this repo, and you will see a "Weekly updates" issue where you can add your updates.</p>

  <h3 class="purple-header">HOLIDAYS</h3>
  <p>If you need to ask for holidays, you can do this through <a href="https://hours.tudelft.nl/tim/home/dashboard/mypresence">My TIM.</a> You should add your holidays (or other periods you are away) to our shared group calendar. Ask your supervisor or Gina to give you access to it. All staff members (specifically PhDs, Postdocs and other project researchers) are requested to take 5 weeks of holidays per year (for example, 1 week in spring, 3 weeks during summer and 1 week in autumn). This can be discussed in more detail with your supervisors, but you are always encouraged to take most of your vacations.</p>

  <h3 class="purple-header">SERVER ACCESS</h3>
  <p>Get <a href="https://github.com/tudelft3d/admin/blob/main/servers/connecting_to_our_servers.md">access to our servers</a>, if you need it (GitHub Access required).</p>

  <h3 class="purple-header">STORAGE</h3>
  <p>Get informed about your <a href="https://github.com/tudelft3d/admin/blob/main/computation_n_storage/storage-options.md">storage options</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/tudelft3d/admin/blob/main/computation_n_storage/computation_options.md">computation options</a> (GitHub Access required).</p>

  <h3 class="purple-header">CODE AND DATA GUIDELINES</h3>
  <p>Make sure you are familiar with <a href="https://github.com/tudelft3d/admin/blob/main/admin/code-and-data-guidelines.md">our guidelines for your code and data management</a> (GitHub Access required).</p>

  <h3 class="purple-header">DIGIFORMS</h3>
  <p>Give Martine access to your Digiforms (for help with expensing):</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Login to <a href="https://forms-fc.tudelft.nl/DigiForms/login.jsp">DigiForms</a> with your NetID and password</li>
    <li>Go to "Authorization" tab (you might need to log in again)</li>
    <li>Type her name in the empty text box (Martine de Jong) and press the "Zoek een gemachtigde" button</li>
    <li>Add her by clicking the box "M.M.M. Jong-Lansbergen" and then click "Voeg geselecteerdeâ€¦".</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="purple-header">Fun list:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>The <em>previous</em> office management strictly enforced the "bake-your-own-birthday-cake" rule. The <em>current</em> management admits to having zero baking skills and fully supports your right to <strong>choose happiness (and store-bought cake)</strong> on your birthday. (You still have to bring one, though.)</li>
    <li>Also please send to Gina your birthday and your first language. We need it for automating the birthday wishes :) </li>
    <li>Consider joining <a href="https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/idea/">the IDEA team</a>.</li>
    <li>Finally, some goodies; ask Gina for some group stickers and a mug!</li>
  </ol>
