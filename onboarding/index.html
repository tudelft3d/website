    <h1 class="purple-header">Welcome to the 3D Geoinformation Group!</h1>
    <p>We're excited to have you join us!</p>

    <p>
        So, you recently joined our group! The first days can be a little
        overwhelming, so we put together a TODO list to ease the process:
    </p>

    <h3 class="purple-header">ACCESS</h3>
    <p>
        Get a NetID and CampusCard (our secretaries Margo or Martine will arrange this for you). You will need your campus card to access our office and – more importantly – to get coffee!
    </p>

    <h3 class="purple-header">COMMUNICATION</h3>
    <p>
        Download <a href="https://telegram.org/">Telegram</a> (if you don't
        already have it) and ask anyone in the group to add you to our group
        chat. It's also helpful if you have a global username so that it's
        easier to add you to group chats. This is our main communication channel
        as a group (even though other people in TU Delft are using Teams). You
        can find your colleagues through the member list of our main channel
        (3DGeoInfo). Please check your messages regularly!
    </p>

    <h3 class="purple-header">DESK</h3>
    <p>
        Do you know where your desk is? If not,
        <a
            href="https://tud365-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/amysterrenberg_tudelft_nl/EZ0W5DvhjFROpnpIwRkrnpwBJyaH9j9zHHRbYBhEzC9Qlg?e=i481pM"
            >check here</a
        >
        to see if a desk has been assigned to you. If not, ask Amy or Gina.
    </p>

    <h3 class="purple-header">GITHUB</h3>
    <p>
        Gina or your supervisor can give you access
        <a href="https://github.com/tudelft3d"
            >to the repositories of our organization</a
        >. Be sure to accept the invitation when you receive it. You will need access to the GitHub organization for various steps below.
    </p>

    <h3 class="purple-header">WEBSITE</h3>
    <p>
        When you have time, you should update
        <a href="https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/about/#people">our website</a> with
        your info on the 'staff' page.
    </p>

    <p>
        You will need to clone
        <a href="https://github.com/tudelft3d/website">the website repository</a
        >, follow the instructions and update the <em>_data/staff.yml</em> file
        (or the <em>_data/staff_visiting.yml</em> file if you are visiting). The
        website gets updated automatically (after a few minutes) when you push
        your changes to the 'main' branch.
    </p>

    <p>You will need the following information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Full name</li>
        <li>Email</li>
        <li>Position/title</li>
        <li>Institute/University (if you are visiting)</li>
        <li>
            A square photo of 200X200px (This is important because we need to
            keep the size of the repo small)
        </li>
        <li>A one-line description of your main project</li>
        <li>
            A lengthier description of your research and background for your
            webpage (if you already have a webpage and you need to host it, it
            can also be done)
        </li>
        <li>Link to website/LinkedIn</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        It would also be nice if you could write a short welcoming post for
        yourself (not necessary for academic visitors). Please have a look at
        previous posts for some inspiration.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you don't have time or encounter any difficulties, Gina can help you!
    </p>

    <h3 class="purple-header">MAILING LIST</h3>
    <p>
        Subscribe to
        <a href="https://listserv.tudelft.nl/mailman/listinfo/3dgeoinfo-bk"
            >our group's mailing list</a
        >. With it, you'll receive all important emails and invites. You can
        also email everyone in the group at
        <code>3dgeoinfo-bk@lists.tudelft.nl</code>.
        <em
            >Please make sure that your supervisor sends you invitations to any
            upcoming but earlier-organised group events and meetings.</em
        >
    </p>

    <h3 class="purple-header">WORKING REMOTELY</h3>
    <p>
        Set up your <a href="https://vpn.tudelft.nl/">TU Delft VPN</a> for
        working off campus. The instruction manual for the configuration can be
        found <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/ict-handleidingen/vpn">here</a>.
    </p>

    <h3 class="purple-header">3DTEA</h3>
    <p>
        In the 3D geoinformation group we have a casual weekly meeting which we
        call 3DTea. This happens <strong>every Thursday at 16:00</strong> and
        people can attend either online or in person. This time is usually used
        for short presentations about recent work/research, or about other
        matters that might interest us. As a newcomer, you will use one of the
        3DTeas to introduce yourself and talk about the work you will be doing
        in the group. Most importantly, you need to include information about
        <strong
            >your favourite dish, favourite music, and favourite
            book/movie/series etc.</strong
        >
        <a
            href="https://tud365.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/3DTea-UDS/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B337C5919-4BDB-4132-8852-E0E1543001FF%7D&file=3DTea%40UDS.xlsx&action=default&mobileredirect=true"
            >Please see the available dates here</a
        >
        or ask Amy.
    </p>

    <h3 class="purple-header">UDS MONTHLY CATCH UP</h3>
    <p>
        Once per month we meet with the whole Urban Data Science section to
        update each other about our work. For this meeting we store the minutes
        in [this repo](https://github.com/tudelft3d/UDS-catch-up). Prior to the
        meeting you will get a notification on Telegram to add your updates.
        Please make sure to fill it in before the meeting!
    </p>

    <h3 class="purple-header">WEEKLY UPDATES</h3>
    <p>
        Every Monday you will receive a reminder on the 3DGeoInfo channel on
        Telegram (from our bot, Wynn) to update the rest of the group on what
        you are working on this week. You should go to 'issues' in this repo,
        and you will see a "Weekly updates" issue where you can add your
        updates.
    </p>

    <h3 class="purple-header">HOLIDAYS</h3>
    <p>
        If you need to request holidays, you can do this through
        <a href="https://hours.tudelft.nl/tim/home/dashboard/mypresence"
            >My TIM.</a
        >
        You should add your holidays (or other periods you are away) to our shared group calendar. Ask your supervisor or Gina to give you access to it. All staff members (specifically PhDs, Postdocs, and other project researchers) are requested to take 5 weeks of holidays per year (for example, 1 week in spring, 3 weeks during summer, and 1 week in autumn). You can discuss this in more detail with your supervisors, but you are always encouraged to take most of your vacation days.
    </p>

    <p>
        Please arrange to get a new laptop through your supervisor and the secretaries. If you need other equipment like a screen or a keyboard, Gina can help you place an order. If you have already received your laptop or other equipment with a TU Delft tag, please make sure to update

    <h2 class="purple-header">Fun list:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            The <em>previous</em> office management strictly enforced the
            "bake-your-own-birthday-cake" rule. The <em>current</em> management
            admits to having zero baking skills and fully supports your right to
            <strong>choose happiness (and store-bought cake)</strong> on your
            birthday. (You still have to bring one, though.)
        </li>
        <li>
            Also please send to Gina your birthday and your first language. We
            need it for automating the birthday wishes :)
        </li>
        <li>
            Consider joining
            <a href="https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/idea/">the IDEA team</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Finally, some goodies; ask Gina for some group stickers and a mug!
