### <strong> Questions about participation</strong>

## Why should I participate?

1. To contribute to <strong>define a useful framework</strong> of the technical solutions for geo- and BIM activities employing open standards;

2. Participants delivering suitable results can be cited in the benchmark <strong>website</strong>;

3. The <strong>scientific material</strong> regarding the used procedures/tools (papers, reports, web resources, open repositories…) will be linked in the benchmark website;

4. At least one <strong>scientific publication</strong> co-authored by both the benchmark proponents and participants will be written.

## How many tasks is it necessary to perform for participating?

You can choose <strong>1 to all</strong> the proposed tasks. Each task is independent from the others, so, even 1 is sufficient.

<!--
## How much time does it take to perform the tasks and deliver results?
The needed time is, approximately:

TIME for Task 1

TIME for Task 2

TIME for Task 3

TIME for Task 4-->

## How will the delivered data and documents be used?

The delivered results will be used (anonymously) to:

1. Perform the analysis and activities foreseen by this project, i.e.:

  * filling of a <strong>list of tools</strong> for geo- and BIM models management in CityGML and IFC to be used as a framework for involved or interested operator;

  * identification of <strong>common issues</strong> in software or open standards and encourage their improvement;

  * contribution to the<strong> discussion</strong> about open standards, geoinformation, BIM, used software tools, models georeferencing, GeoBIM;

  * publication of results in <strong>scientific papers and communications</strong>;

  * in-depth<strong> insight</strong> during the project meeting and the GeoBIM winter school;

if you want to have more details, read the [complete description of the project](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/projects/geobim-benchmark/project.html) in this website.

2. Be reference for related <strong>research activities</strong>;

3. They will be published (anonymously) as <strong>open data</strong> together with the other benchmark results for further research activities.


To be sure that the participants agree with this use of the results, they are asked to check some declarations at the end of the online results templates they will deliver.

## What should I do if my tests are not successful?

If issues prevent any task to be completed until the end,<strong> you can anyway deliver the results</strong> you obtained, giving detailed descriptions of the found problems.

## Is it possible to participate testing a software and/or making a task different from the ones declared in the first registration?

Yes, eventually, it is not a problem. But, if possible, we wil be grateful if you communicate the change through e-mail (f.noardo@tudelft.nl) as soon as you decide.

## How do I have to do the test and deliver results?

<strong>Results templates</strong> are provided for each task in order to guide the test in each passage and deliver detailed results. They have the format of online forms, where doc/pdf/jpg files can be attached in specific sections, when required. The results template in word format is also available, to have an overview on the specific task, to be used as a guideline in making the test, and, eventually, to be attached in the case it is necessary to deliver more detailed descriptions.

## Why should I also attach the word format of the results template?
It is not compulsory to add it, just do it if you have any doubt about the given answers in the online form (e.g. no space enough for the descriptions or screenshots, no space for other needed details, and similar issues).

## In filling the results templates while preforming the task, is it possible to refer to web materials already answering the question (e.g. describing needed procedures or settings, and so on)?

Yes, it is possible. Those should be eventually integrated with any further needed detail.

### <strong> Glossary and other definitions </strong>

## What are geographic coordinate systems?

A <strong>geographic coordinate system (GCS) </strong>defines a location on the Earth surface through coordinates describing the angles measured from the earth's center to a point on the earth's surface. An angular unit of measure, a prime meridian, and a datum (ellipsoid) describe a GCS.

Latitude is the vertical angle from the centre of the Earth.

Lines of equal latitude on the reference ellipsoid are parallels.

The 0 latitude parallel is the equator (line of latitude midway between the poles).

Longitude is the horizontal angle from the centre of the Earth.

Lines of equal longitude on the reference ellipsoid are meridians.

The 0 longitude (prime) meridian, for most geographic coordinate systems, passes through Greenwich, England.

Possible references for an extended description can be found, among many other resources, in the [QGIS online documentation](https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/gentle_gis_introduction/coordinate_reference_systems.html), and in the [ArcGIS online documentation](http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/guide-books/map-projections/about-geographic-coordinate-systems.htm)

## What are projected coordinate systems?

A <strong>projected coordinate system</strong> relates a 2D location on the Earth surface to a location described as 2D coordinates (distances) on a Cartesian plane, once defined a measure unit, an origin, a projection system.

A projection system is the used method for drawing the objects on a curved surface (namely, the ellipsoid surface) on a planar surface.

Possible references for an extended description can be found, among many other resources, in the [QGIS online documentation](https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/gentle_gis_introduction/coordinate_reference_systems.html), and in the [ArcGIS online documentation](http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/guide-books/map-projections/about-geographic-coordinate-systems.htm)

## What are vertical coordinate systems?

A <strong>vertical coordinate system</strong> defines the origin for height or depth values with reference to a geoid (model of the Earth considering the surface having the same effective potential).

Mean sea level is used as the zero level for height values.

A linear unit of measure is used.

Possible references for an extended description can be found, among many other resources, in the [QGIS online documentation](https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/gentle_gis_introduction/coordinate_reference_systems.html), and in the [ArcGIS online documentation](http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/guide-books/map-projections/fundamentals-of-vertical-coordinate-systems.htm).

For 3D data, combined horizontal and vertical reference systems are often used.

## What is the EPSG code?

It is a code identifying the existing reference systems and pointing at the resources describing their parameters. You can read more it [here](http://www.epsg.org/).

## IFC certification

The <strong>IFC certification</strong> by buildingSMART is described in the specific section of the [buildingSMART website](http://www.buildingsmart-tech.org/certification). In that page you can read information about the certification programs, which depends on the considered IFC version and Model View Definition. For example, a list of software under certification process for the IFC certification program 'IFC2x3 CV V2.0' can be read at this [link](http://www.buildingsmart-tech.org/certification/ifc-certification-2.0/ifc2x3-cv-v2.0-certification/participants).
