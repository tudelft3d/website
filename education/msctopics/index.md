## Modelling wind flows around beach housing to promote dune formation for flood protection

‘Building with Nature’ is an innovative approach in coastal engineering & design, where natural forces are employed to improve flood protection. Along sandy shores, like the Netherlands, the dunes are the first line of defense; and they need sediment transport by the wind to grow along with sea level rise. However, more and more beaches are urbanized, affecting the sediment flow to the dunes. Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations can give a better insight in the wind and turbulence around built objects, specifically to predict what urban configurations promote wind-driven sediment flow to the dunes. 

In this MSc thesis we will simulate wind patterns around beach housing via CFD modelling to investigate what type of urban configurations perform best to contribute to the sediment flow to the dunes. The study goal is twofold: 1) we will analyze the effect of several types of urban beach configurations in perpendicular and parallel wind conditions; 2) we will evaluate their performance and create a feedback loop with the design parameters to explore potential improvements. Results will contribute to a preliminary set of urban layouts that will be tested by scaled models on the beach in spring 2021. The thesis will be part of the ShoreScape research project (TU Delft & University of Twente 2017-2022, funded by NWO)

## Web application for Urban Computational Fluid Dynamics Simulations Set-Up validation.

Performing computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations in urban environments entails many pre-run set-up features that can have a drastic impact in the simulations performance. For example, the extension of the domain should be large enough to limit blockage around the buildings, or the mesh resolution should be refined enough to ensure the flow results grid independence. Many of these pre-run processes can be partially automatic, and tools that quickly check if the simulation set-up respects the CFD guidelines can be developed.

In this MSc thesis we will develop a web application that allows to import CFD set-ups from users and check their compatibility with the most up to data CFD guidelines developed by the wind engineering community. The application will analyze the set-up and report back to the user with potential improvements, if needed. 

If you work on this topic, you can expect to learn about CFD best practice guidelines, set-ups and flow simulations, as well as web development. Programming experience and interest is an advantage for this topic. Your work will require to implement source code for the analysis of the set-ups (in C++ or Python) and the web interface (in HTML and JavaScript).

## Exploring efficient ways to visualize and handle large data sets

![](img/Qcontour3_Q035-10_U3.png){:width="400px"}

Diverse processes in urban simulations, such as high-fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) simulations and the reconstruction of accurate 3D city models relay in the usability of very large datasets. 
This applications focused in realistic urban scenarios can be dealing with number of data points that lay in the hundreds of millions. 
The visualization and usability of these large datasets is a common problem that we often face, and determining efficient ways to deal with it would be of paramount importance. 

In this MSc thesis we will explore the existing techniques to deal with such problems, and build up from them to analyze and potentially develop additional strategies that ease this challenge. 
The application results from the thesis can largely impact fields of geomatics, CFD communities as well as 3D data visualization.

If you work on this topic, you can expect to learn about flow patterns (as in wind), geometric operations on 3D city models and multiple tools for visualization used for 3D city models and CFD results. 
Programming experience is an advantage for this topic, since parallelization of the processes might be needed to improve the usability of large scale data.

## Testing and extension of a GIS-supported design tool for new urban development areas

![](img/ga_giscity_2020.jpg){:width="600px"}

The thesis builds upon work carried out in a previous MSc [thesis](http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:844b92d4-aa22-4ae7-b6c3-3b563dd3318e) - check out the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPYT5_cFIgw)! - in which a first prototype of a geodata-supported design tool for new urban development areas was created. The tool is coupled with semantic 3D city models as a source of integrated spatial and non-spatial information.
The thesis will focus first on thoroughly testing the existing tool and will then implement new functionalities. Possible examples are the computation of KPIs for urban analyses, 3D web-based visualisation and interaction interfaces, as well as scenarios management. The precise development focus of the thesis will be agreed upon with the student.

The research will be carried out on a selected case study and in cooperation with the Cross Domain-City of the Future graduation [studio](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/education/programmes/masters/architecture-urbanism-and-building-sciences/msc-architecture-urbanism-and-building-sciences/master-tracks/architecture/programme/studios/city-of-the-future/), which focuses on how to design and develop in an integrated way a transformation area into an attractive future urban environment.

## Utilization of alternative fuels in the transport sector and identification of their emission reduction potential regarding harmful air pollution

The air quality in cities is one of the big topics of modern society. This air quality is affected form harmful emission like nitrogen oxides and particulate matter that are, in urban areas, mainly produced from the transport sector. A promising option besides changing the modal split or reducing mileages is the change to alternative fuels. To identify suitable application cases for alternative fuels, analyses to determine which vehicles are the main polluters in agglomerations are mandatory. 

In the framework of this master thesis, you will work independently with a model developed at the Forschungszentrum Jülich that considers the mileages and resulting emissions of road transport, rail transport, inland waterway transport and air transport considering different fuels and conditions. Mileages and emissions are spatially presented in the results of the model. Your work will include development and extension of this model as well as the analysis of results for different future scenarios. The model is implemented in Python and QGIS is used to plot results.

This project is done in cooperation with Forschungszentrum Jülich GmbH, Jülich, Germany. The work will take place in Jülich, Germany. Experience in programming and a basic in German language is beneficial, but not essential.

## Coupling 3D city models with Ladybug tools for environmental analyses

<img src="img/ga_ladybug.jpg" style="width: 600px;"/>

The MSc thesis will focus on interoperability between the Ladybug tools and semantic 3D city models encoded in CityJSON and extended with the Energy ADE. The [Ladybug Tools](https://www.ladybug.tools/) are a collection of free applications that support environmental design and education. They are among the most comprehensive, connecting 3D Computer-Aided Design (CAD) interfaces to a host of validated simulation engines. The thesis builds upon a previous [MSc thesis](https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid:fb35db7c-9af8-488c-8d0b-263b138d8fd3) completed in 2020.

Particular attention will be paid to energy-related topics in order verify how and to which extent the CityGML [Energy ADE](http://www.citygmlwiki.org/index.php/CityGML_Energy_ADE) (Application Domain Extension) can be used to deliver and store additional energy-related data needed by the Ladybug tools.

The students’ task will consist in choosing (together with the supervisors) a specific application covered by a Ladybug tool, to analyse the software and data requirements of the selected Ladybug tool(s) and to perform a mapping to underlying CityGML/Energy ADE data models. In addition, proper interfaces will have to be developed and tested by means of a concrete case study. This topic is available for up to *two students* (each one choosing a different application area).

## Where will you lose your hat? Finding the windiest street in the Netherlands
Wind speeds in small scale regional maps are commonly used to derive wind harvesting potential. Sometimes, these type of maps can also be used to infer the wind speed on the city level. However, we do not know yet how do such interpolated wind speeds correspond to real wind speeds in an urban setting, since the landscape and building structures largely modify the flow patterns. 

In this MSc thesis we will use Netherlands wind maps and 3D city models to explore the correspondence between larger wind maps and local winds. The data inherent in 3D city models will be used to derive fundamental parameters that describe urban morphologies, such as skyview factor, length-to-width ratio, orientation or building density. Through these parameters we will classify diverse urban areas, and explore relations between the derived urban parameters and the local potential for wind enhancement or reduction over the Netherlands. 

If you work on this topic, you can expect to learn about flow patterns (as in wind), geometric operations on 3D city models, how to convert a city object, city-parts into a machine-learnable representation, how various urban layouts influence wind distributions. Ideally, you would also explore how to scale up the operation to a whole country, and optionally you may also learn how to run Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) simulations for wind.

## GIS-based integrated modelling of building stock and supply networks for assessment of near-zero energy districts

This MSc thesis topic will be jointly supervised by staff of the 3D Geoinformation group (Dept. of Urbanism) and the Climate Design group (Dept. of Architectural Engineering and Technology). Ideally, two students (one for each research group) will work together, however focusing each on one of the following topics:

![](img/energy2019.jpg){:width="600px"}

For the Geomatics track, the focus will be on modelling the building stock and the (energy) supply networks of a district in an integrated GIS environment. CityGML and its extensions Energy ADE and Utility Network ADE will be considered for the purpose. At least a basic knowledge of CityGML is required for this topic.
The focus of the energy track will be on developing a GIS-based Urban Energy Model (UEM) which simulates the building energy performance on the urban-scale. While the building  energy efficiency is getting greater attention, there is a lack of building energy simulation on the urban scale. The UEM has to be computationally efficient and simultaneously use a set of input parameters that is aggregated to a level which is proportional with the urban GIS data. This will make the model suited for the macro-level simulations. The data relates to the basic building information such as wall and window areas, shading coefficients, material properties, floor area, lighting density, internal heat production from appliances, plug loads, and occupancy schedules. 
The above-mentioned GIS-model will be integrated with the UEM, as well as design algorithm, in order to extract suitable data to be used as input to the energy models. The GIS platform collected and synthesized the data and then will be used as the input of the UEM to get energy use of buildings in the area. The model will also be applied to evaluate the energy savings of desired retrofit scenarios.
In case only one or more than 2 students are interested in this MSc thesis, specific arrangements will be made together with the supervisors.

## Façade parsing from textured meshes

![](img/facade_parsing.png){:width="600px"}

Recent advances in Structure from Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo (MVS) enable generating textured meshes of large urban scenes. Many real-world applications (e.g., sun light simulation) require detailed semantic information of these models. This project aims at partitioning the façade models into semantically meaning regions, i.e., walls, doors, windows, chimneys, and balconies using state-of-the-art machine learning / deep learning techniques.

**Required Skills**: 
Experiences in 3D mesh processing; Proficient in one programming language (e.g., C/C++ or Python); Attendance in courses (CS4220, or CS4240, or related online courses) on machine learning / deep learning.

## Improving automatic meshing for buildings

![](img/MeshConceptCFD.png){:width="600px"}
Computational fluid dynamic simulations require detailed meshes that can represent obstacles features accurately. In numerical simulations, the quality of the mesh can draw the line between good and poor results. Nowadays, mesh tools are general and they are not necessarily optimised for meshing entire cities, requiring large time investments to design and improve the mesh quality.

This MSc project focuses on developing an algorithm that create the mesh automatically around buildings by specifying a limited number of parameters that define the grid cells sizes. The mesh will be generated from a top-up perspective, initially extruding the geometrical edges to create cell layers close to the buildings. The approach will be first tested in 2D single and multiple building geometries.

Knowledge of programming in python is required.
Following elective course GEO5013 is an advantage.

## Automatic reconstruction of historical 3D city models

![](img/delft_1600.jpg){:width="500px"}


Several cities are currently attempting to reconstruct historial 3D models of their cities, see for instance [Rotterdam before/during/after WWII](https://www.stadsarchief.rotterdam.nl/rotterdam3d).
As far I know, all the efforts have been made manually, by hiring several students to draw buildings from historical photos.

The aim of the project is to investigate how historical 3D models of cities can be *automatically* reconstructed.
The idea is to use [2D topographic maps](https://www.topotijdreis.nl) and other sources (eg cadastre) and infer the height of buidings, [maybe with machine learning](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/hledoux/pdfs/17_ceus_3dnoelevation.pdf).

## Modelling tree topology effects on wind

![](img/FlowAroundTrees.png)

Urban landscapes incorporate vegetation elements that serve for different purposes. In open spaces trees can be used to ameliorate air quality, while in other locations they can help to mitigate heat island effects or to improve pedestrian wind comfort. Flow simulations in urban canopies usually oversight resolving tree structures. However, trees have been shown to always affect the wind flow, in some cases with non-negligible impacts.

In this MSc thesis we will simulate explicitly the wind around diverse tree topologies. The results will be compared with standard approaches that approximate the drag imposed by the tree on the wind flow. The study goal is twofold: 1) we will analyze the effect of different tree shapes, and their impact on the flow structure; 2) we will evaluate the performance of  traditional drag approaches and explore potential improvements.

Knowledge of programming in python is highly desirable.

## Calculating street widths

![](img/RoadWidthMScTopicFull.png){:width="700px"}

This project will be in partnership with researchers in the department of Urbanism examining the relationship between street design and automated vehicles. As part of this thesis you will examine ways to automatically calculate the width of roads (this is considered the total width including pedestrian walkways and cycling lanes). Part of this process will require you to find ways to automatically classify intersection areas as well as develop methods to automatically partition road segments. 

Knowledge of a programming language (preferably Python) is highly recommended.

## Inferring the needed building permission from a 3D building model

![](img/dormersrotterdam.png){:width="400px"}

In the Municipality of Rotterdam the building regulations are very different if a construction work on a roof is a dormer, an additional floor, or something else. It can be difficult to figure out what regulations apply for a given construction plan. To make this easier the municipality of Rotterdam would like to offer a tool that can automatically determine what permits are needed, given a 3D geometry of the building plans. The tool should be able to infer what kind of object is designed and provide to the designer the needed regulations and constraints.

In this research the aim is:
- to build a web application that can read an LoD2 CityJSON model of the current situation and allows the user to modify the building with the desired modifications;
- to develop a method that can infer what kind of object was designed in the web application (only objects on the roof will be considered) and deliver the related regulations accordingly.

## 3D digital urban regulations to use GeoBIM for building permission checks

The automation of urban regulation checks for the planning use case requires the urban regulations to be archived in a digital and spatial (3D) format.
This project aims at the definition of an effective way to store those regulations digitally and spatially, for their use in checking urban regulations compliancy of new buildings through GeoBIM integrated information. The studied solution could start from extending [CityGML](https://www.citygmlwiki.org), employing [INSPIRE](https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/data-model/approved/r4618-ir/html/) data model, or other available standards.

## Extracting building/storey/dwelling/room shapes from a BIM models

![](img/UpTown5.gif){:width="400px"}

Given a Building Information Model in Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) format, it is necessary to extract useful information for automatic processes, such as the building envelope, number of dwellings, storeys or rooms in the building and the respective volumes and dimensions, for example to support compliancy check with the urban regulations.

Prior algorithmic knowlegde, recursion, graph concepts could be beneficial.

## Improving the automatic LoD2 building reconstruction from AHN3

![](img/lod2-add-spheres.jpg){:width="800px"}

We have a working method to automatically reconstruct LoD2.2/LoD1.3 buildings from the AHN3 point cloud that we are using to construct LoD2 building models for the whole of the Netherlands. These models will for example be used as input data for noise simulation, and will be available as open data as part of the next version of our [3D BAG dataset](http://3dbag.bk.tudelft.nl).

The aim of this project will be to improve/extend the method with one or several of the following items:

* The detection of primitive shapes in roof structures such as speheres and cones. Currently the method can only detect planes. If we also detect other types of primitive we will be able to create more accurate models.
* Making the method work without requiring a building footprint as input (next to the point cloud). Currently the method 'forces' the boundary of the model to exactly follow the BAG footprint. However, these are not always accurate and may include underground parts of the building that we would like to ignore.

Programming required, C++ recommended.

## Point cloud normal estimation based on the 3D medial axis transform

![](img/wrong_normal_orientation.png){:width="400px"}

Point clouds, unstructured collections of 3D points in space, are nowadays collected with different acquisition methods, eg photogrammetry and LiDAR.
While current point clouds are dense and offer an accurate representation of real-world objects and landscapes, they lack structure and semantics.

The aim of this project is to properly *orient* a point cloud, ie to find an approximation of the normal at each point; this normal should point outwards.
Surface normals are essential for different processing of a point cloud, eg visualisation, shadow analysis or segmentation.

"Standard" methods, eg [that function in PCL](http://pointclouds.org/documentation/tutorials/normal_estimation.php), usually find the nearest points of a given point, fit a plane, and choose between the 2 possible normals (up or down) based on a viewpoint.
The problem is that in practice, eg with the [AHN3 dataset](http://www.ahn.nl), we do not have that information.

The topic involved building on our work with the [3D medial-axis transform (MAT)](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/projects/3dsm/) and use the 3D MAT of a point cloud as a base to obtain high quality normals with a proper orientation.

It is possible to use Python for this project, although some knowledge of C++ would surely help.

## Converting the national road netwerk (NWB) from 2D into 3D

![](img/nwb.jpg){:width="700px"}

The National Road Dataset (Nationaal Wegen Bestand, NWB) will convert their [2D road network into 3D](https://nationaalwegenbestand.nl/nieuws/hoogte-informatie-toegevoegd-aan-nwb-voor-omgevingswet) by developing automated reconstruction algorithms based on LiDAR data (AHN). This is specifically challenging at the location of tunnels, bridges, viadutcs etc. This research will help in this work by developing algorithms to reconstruct the 3D NWB for the whole Netherlands.

## 3D Cadastre

![](img/3DCadastre.png){:width="700px"}

Since more than 15 years, lots of studies have been done on 3D Cadastre to register multilevel ownership in a transparent and proper way.
In 2016, we realised the first 3D cadastral situation [3D cadastral registration]( https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/news/2016/03/21/3DKadaster.html) in the Netherlands.
However, there is still a gap between research and practice. In this research you will analyse how a Level of Detail Framework, that defines specifc solutions for specific 3d cadatsre problems may help to close the 3D cadastre research-to-practice gap.
The idea is explained in [this](https://www.fig.net/resources/proceedings/fig_proceedings/fig2020/papers/ts04e/TS04E_stoter_ho_et_al_10503_abs.pdf) short paper

## Snap rounding in a triangulation

![](img/triangulation.png){:width="500px"}

The most common way to do edge-matching or to clean small inconsistencies within and between datasets is to apply snapping (point-to-point or point-to-line).
However, simple snapping creates many problems, including topological changes and inconsistencies.
Snap rounding extends this method in order to give robustness guarantees, but current implementations, such as [the one in CGAL](http://doc.cgal.org/latest/Snap_rounding_2/index.html), are *extremely* slow.
Related to this, in the project [pprepair](https://github.com/tudelft3d/pprepair), we have previously used a constrained triangulation as a robust method to repair polygons and planar partitions.
Using this approach topological errors are automatically fixed.
We therefore believe that using a triangulation as a base structure is an intuitive and efficient way to optimize snap rounding, since we can perform simple snapping and recover from topological errors afterwards.

The existing prototype ([pprepair](https://github.com/tudelft3d/pprepair) that needs to be extended has been developed in C++, thus the knowledge of C++---or a strong desire to learn it---is necessary.

## Instance segmentation of trees from point clouds

![](img/tree_instances.png)

Amazing techniques (e.g., [AdTree](https://github.com/tudelft3d/adtree)) have been recently proposed to 
reconstruct 3D models of real-world trees in great details. These methods assume that the tree instances 
have been segmented from the massive point clouds. However, good quality segmentation of individual trees 
is typically achieved by tedious manual work in practice. The automatic segmentation still remains an open problem. 

The aim of this thesis project is to develop a method to automatically and precisely locate and identify
individual trees in the scan of a large urban area (the TU Delft campus, for instance), allowing for 
unified processing of all the trees in the covered area. The result of the instance segmentation can be used in
various applications, e.g., detailed 3D modeling and identification of tree species.

**Required Skills**: 
Proficient in one programming language (e.g., Python or C/C++); interested and willing to follow courses in machine 
learning (in particular Deep Learning).

## Integrated modelling of utility networks in the urban environment

<img src="img/ga_xander_network.jpg" style="width: 500px;"/>

In the framework of Smart Cities, the MSc thesis will focus on interoperability issues when it comes the heterogeneous utility networks (e.g. gas, water, electricity, sewage, district heating, telecommunications, etc.) that are found in the urban environment.
Starting from a CityGML-based 3D city model, the Msc. thesis will focus on testing the Utility Network ADE (Application Domain Extension) and compare it to existing or newly proposed standards (IMKL or MUDDI), based on a concrete case study which will be agreed upon with the student. 
The image shown here is taken from a previous [thesis](https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid:fed24b16-cf95-4fa0-a109-ece6e91b61e9?collection=education) and serves as example - and starting point - of the overall topic of the thesis proposed here.

## Computation of spatial extent for massive point cloud datasets

![](img/alphashape.png)

Given a raw LAS pointcloud datasets, how to generate its [spatial extent (a polygon)](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/courses/backup/geo1015/2019/les/13/)?

Finding the bounding-box (or the convex hull, or with a raster solution) is in most cases not sufficient, as the image above shows.
A better solution is to use the alpha-shape of the set of points, or similar complex structures.
The problem we would be tackling here is: how to do this for a dataset of say 800M points? It doesn't fit in memory, so what can we do?

## Performance and robustness of software libraries for computational geometry

![](img/sweep_geometry.png){:width="500px"}

Software libraries for computational geometry underpin a lot of our research, but an in-depth comparison of how these different software libraries behave in terms of performance and robustness is not available. For example, the feasability of multi-disciplinary use of geometry in BIM/GIS integration and automated thermal analysis of IFC building models is largely shaped by the characteristics of the algorithmns offered in open source libraries such as CGAL and Open CASCADE. This research project is an opportunity to publish something novel, useful and relevant to many disciplines.

## CityRest: RESTful access + streaming of 3D city models

![](img/draco.gif){:width="300px"}

[CityJSON](https://cityjson.org) was developed to improve on the weaknesses of the XML-encoding of [CityGML](http://www.citygml.org/).
One of the major one is that CityGML files cannot be used on the web, they are often too big and too complex.

CityJSON fixed this (6X more compact and [ninja](https://ninja.cityjson.org/) shows a proof-of-concept), and this MSc topic will explore solutions and architectures to offer a [RESTful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) web access to datasets, and also the possibility to *stream* them to a viewer (eg ninja; image above is from [Draco](https://cesium.com/blog/2018/04/09/draco-compression/)).

There is a newly developed standard that promises to do this: [OGC API--Features](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/17-069r3/17-069r3.html) (this is "WFS3" but with a new name).
Most of the demos are for simple 2D geometries, complex features of a 3D city model are not clearly supported (eg textures, 2+ geometries, several LoDs, etc.).

I have built a quick [proof-of-concept and a proposal](https://github.com/hugoledoux/cityjson_ogcapi) (see also the [demo](http://hugoledoux.pythonanywhere.com/)), and this project would bring this further by investigating how to support streaming, how to setup the server (right now it is simple and "cheap").
The aim would be to host most [publicly available 3D city models](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/opendata/opencities/) on such a server, and benchmark what would be the "optimal" solution.
A bit ambitious, I know.

## Where do I turn? Investigate modelling of road networks in CityJSON, with implicit geometries

![](img/ComplexInterchangesVisualisation.png){:width="700px"}

Roads are supported by CityJSON, but there is minimal support for road networks so far.
As part of a previous [thesis](http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:ebfc48f8-4704-47d3-9654-cd00c765e0af), we have intestigated the requirements for complete roads representation for certain use cases.

In this thesis, the goal is to further refine the requirements to conclude to a concrete representation of road networks.
The point of the thesis is to utilise all possible mechanisms that CityJSON offers to store semantics of roads in the most efficient ways (e.g. geometry instancing, geometry semantics).
How will we store the network?
Can we imply the 3D geometry of roads from simple networks?
Can we store all necessary information with the existing functionality of CityJSON or is more necessary?

We are in the process of producing some sample road datasets.
As part of the project, you'll have to experiment with multiple representations, create variations, find interesting parties and evaluate the best way to have roads in CityJSON.

## Automatic repair of 3D city models

![](img/repairorientation.gif){:width="400px"}

Most 3D city models that are publicly available contain so many geometric errors (self-intersections, missing faces, duplicate vertices, etc.) that [they are more or less unusable in practice](https://speakerdeck.com/hugoledoux/how-useful-are-current-3d-city-models).

The aim of this project is to __automatically__ repair 3D city models, we can focus on the [publicly available models](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/opendata/opencities/) so there is plenty of data to play with.
While repair is a very-complex issue (if all cases are to be handled), this project will target the most common errors, and fix them. 
The [val3dity server](http://geovalidation.bk.tudelft.nl/val3dity/) has been logging all the validation reports for the last 4 years, so a starting point will be to analyse those and focus on what is most easy and has an impact.
Duplicate points and non-planar surfaces are pretty easy to solve; and for single polygons we [already have working code (prepair)](https://github.com/tudelft3d/prepair).
After that, more complex operators (eg [those from CGAL](https://doc.cgal.org/latest/Polygon_mesh_processing/index.html)) could be used.

The project is difficult to be done in Python, C++ is necessary (but it's a great way to improve!).
CityJSON files will be used, you will not have to deal with (the pain of parsing) CityGML files, I promise.

## How to construct one __seamless__ TIN from all the AHN3 points in NL?

![](img/bigtin.jpg){:width="300px"}

The AHN3 dataset contains a lot of points (should be close to 1 trillion when completed), and while these are useful, some applications would benefit from having a TIN.
You learned how to create a Delaunay TIN in GEO1015, but what you did was for small datasets that fit in memory.

The aim of this project is to construct __one seamless TIN__ of all the (ground) points in AHN3.
Tiling is possible, but perhaps more interesting would be to use the [streaming ideas of Isenburg and friends](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~isenburg/papers/ilss-scdt-06.pdf); see also the [GEO1015 lesson 12](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/courses/backup/geo1015/2019/les/12/).
Their code is working but not open-source, only works with float (Dutch EPSG:28992 gets truncated...) and is not working.
The idea is to modify their code and implement own, and release this as open-source.

Ideally, at the end it would be nice to press "enter", and in one shoot a gigantic TIN is created.

While Python is theoretically possible (the problem is not speed, but managing the size of the dataset so that at one point only a fraction of it is in memory), it's better if C++ was used.

## Infer the number of floors for all buildings in NL

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/T2Y7oo3iB40" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The [Basisregistraties Adressen en Gebouwen (BAG)](https://www.kadaster.nl/bag) is the most detailed, openly available data set on buildings and addresses in the Netherlands. 
It contains information about each address in a building, such as its current use, construction date or registration status. 
The 2D polygons in the BAG represent the footprint of the building as the projection of the roof’s outline.

What it lacks, and that is wanted by several practitioners, is the __number of floors__ in a given building.
While this sounds easy (if *h* is the [height of the building](http://3dbag.bk.tudelft.nl/), then *#floors = math.floor(h/3)*, right?), in practice it is a lot more messy.

The aim of this project is to dive into that topic and solve it once and for all.
You could use the real shape of the roof (to be extracted from AHN3), year-of-construction, and other attributes that are available.
Furthermore, several municipalities have collected the number of floors for buildings, and those datasets could be used as ground truth, or as training for machine learning.

We would like to run this for the whole country and integrate this new attribute in our [3D BAG service](http://3dbag.bk.tudelft.nl/).

Potentially in collaboration with [Deltares](https://www.deltares.nl/en/).

Programming in Python and SQL is sufficient.
