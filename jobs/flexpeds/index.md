## Job description
We are looking for a Postdoc that will work on the topic of 3D geoinformation for energy data and flexibility management for Positive Energy Districts.

The 3-year position is part of the upcoming **FlexPED (“Energy Data and Flexibility Management for Positive Energy Districts”)** project. The interdisciplinary consortium of this project, consisting of partners from Austria, Bulgaria, Germany, Netherlands and Poland, will develop new research methods and implementation strategies to tackle the need for energy flexibility in Positive Energy Districts (PEDs). Solutions based on AI-powered Urban Digital Twins (UDT) will be tested in two demonstrator cities, and will contribute to reduce the fragmentation in term of data gaps, poor interoperability, and silos-based decision making that very often hinder the deployment of coordinated flexibility measures.

The research topics to be addressed in the project are:
- How and to which extent can agent-based energy simulations, powered by AI-driven forecasts within a UDT platform, contribute to accelerating the realisation of PEDs?
- How can standards (e.g. in terms of data models and APIs) support this process, e.g. by streamlining data retrieval, integration and usage?
- How can specific, user-friendly dashboards be developed in order to facilitate the interaction of different stakeholders (e.g. municipal authorities, energy providers, citizens, etc.) with the Urban Digital Twins?

The [3D Geoinformation group](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl) at TU Delft will be involved in several tasks dealing with technical aspects aimed at the development of data integration services for energy data management and flexibility in city districts. The main tasks of TU Delft, to be carried out in co-operation with the other project partners, will be:
- Investigation on and analysis of spatial and non-spatial data and requirements of the software tools to be used and integrated in the resulting “FlexPED” software platform to be developed within the project
- Extension/update of the CityGML new [Energy Application Domain Extension (ADE)](https://github.com/tudelft3d/Energy_ADE) to deal with energy data coming from industrial sites, and further development of the data model to better align with energy-related data from BIM models and standards (e.g. gbXML)
- Development of OGC-compliant APIs to deliver real-time, 3D, and cross-sectoral urban data to the UDT platform in a private and secure manner. This will include, for example, the implementation of the SensorThings API, which will stream real-time AI-generated forecasts into a FROST server.

To support the research work of the TU Delft team, we have opened this 3-year research position in our 3D Geoinformation research group, section Urban Data Science, Department of Urbanism, Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment. You are expected to contribute to and lead some of the above tasks.

## Research group
The [3D Geoinformation group](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/) focuses on the technologies underpinning geographical information systems (GIS), and aims at designing, developing, and implementing better systems to model 3D cities, buildings and landscapes. It is a multidisciplinary group of around 25 people, including computer scientists, geomatics engineers, and geographers; 6 of them are tenured staff (1 professor, 3 associate professors, and 2 assistant professors). The group has a history of successful collaborations with industry and government in the past: its research has led to open source software, standards, and patents for the management of 3D geographic information and Building Information Models.

## Job requirements
<!-- 600 char --> 
To be eligible to apply, you should:
- Hold an PhD in geoinformatics/geomatics, computer sciences or engineering (or in a related discipline), ideally with some previous experience also in energy-related topics
- Have experience primarily in data modelling, software development, data integration, management of data mainly from semantic 3D city model (e.g. CityGML) and, secondarily, from BIM (e.g. IFC)
- Have good programming skills, especially in Java, Python, and SQL
- Have a good command of English (oral and written)
- Have an affinity with working in multi-disciplinary teams in an internationally oriented environment.


## What we offer
- Duration of contract is 3 years.
- A job of 38-40 hours per week. 
Salary and benefits are in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities. The TU Delft offers a customisable compensation package, discounts on health insurance, and a monthly work costs contribution. Flexible work schedules can be arranged.
