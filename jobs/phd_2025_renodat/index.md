## Job description
In the upcoming **RenoDAT** (“Accelerating Building RENOvation and Decarbonization Through DATa Integration”) project, an interdisciplinary consortium led by TU Delft will develop new research methods and implementation strategies to foster the digitalization of the built environment to accelerate the implementation of the Renovation Passport for buildings.

The project is a collaboration of universities, universities of applied sciences, governmental organizations and private companies and funded by the Dutch Research Council (NWO) within the “Digitalisation of Energy Renovations in the Built Environment” framework, The project aims to fill the knowledge gaps on data governance, ownership, privacy, and harmonization for data-driven energy renovation of the building stock.

The overarching goals are:
- To contribute to speeding up the rate of housing renovation in order reach the climate goals in time
- To facilitate access to transparent, accessible, and comprehensive energy-relevant building data on the existing building stock
- To develop a data infrastructure that enables the collection, management, and sharing of such building data for Renovation Passports to support various energy renovation applications
- To connect to the ongoing developments at national and international scale that cover both spatial and non-spatial data, for example in terms of integration between BIM and 3D city models.

The [3D Geoinformation group](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/) at TU Delft will be involved in several technical tasks that will explore the challenges of coupling, enriching and integrating available public and private data sources that will underpin the Building Renovation Passport. In particular, our main tasks to be carried out in co-operation with the other project partners are:

- Investigation and analysis of data requirements for the Building Renovation Passport, starting from the existing national and international legislation, policies and standards
- Analysis of the gaps between existing data sources and those required by the Renovation Passport, in terms of type, format, accuracy, completeness, reliability, ownership, etc.
- Development of data harmonisation and integration strategies supporting the Building Renovation Passport, covering both spatial and non- spatial aspects and considering existing standard data models and APIs and their possible extension or adaptation for the project goals
- Development of solutions that build upon and extend the current data infrastructure, together with the other partners
- Development and testing of a prototype application together with the other partners to compute the energy performance certificate of a building (unit) and couple it with energy simulation tools.

To support the research work of the TU Delft team, we have opened a 4-year PhD position in our 3D Geoinformation research group, section Urban Data Science, Department of Urbanism, Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment. This PhD candidate is expected to contribute to the above tasks.

[Another PhD position](https://careers.tudelft.nl/job/Delft-PhD-in-Scaling-Renovation-Passports-through-Responsible-Business-Models-and-Management-Learning-2628-CD/821496202/) has been opened for the RenoDAT project at TU Delft, in the section Real Estate Management, Department of Management of the Built Environment, Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment. Both PhDs will collaborate to contribute to the project  overarching goals.


## Research group
The [3D Geoinformation group](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/) focuses on the technologies underpinning geographical information systems (GIS), and aims at designing, developing, and implementing better systems to model 3D cities, buildings and landscapes. It is a multidisciplinary group of around 25 people, including computer scientists, geomatics engineers, and geographers; 6 of them are tenured staff (1 professor, 3 associate professors, and 2 assistant professors). The group has a history of successful collaborations with industry and government in the past: its research has led to open source software, standards, and patents for the management of 3D geographic information and Building Information Models.

## Job requirements
<!-- 600 char --> 
Applicants should:

- hold an MSc in geoinformatics/geomatics, computer sciences or engineering (or in a related discipline)
- have experience in data modelling, data integration, software development, management of data from BIM and semantic 3D city model (in particular: IFC and CityGML),
- have good programming skills (e.g. in Python, SQL, Java, JavaScript, etc.)
- have a good command of English (oral and written)
- have an affinity with working in multi-disciplinary teams in an internationally oriented environment.

Knowledge of Dutch language is a plus but not required.


## What we offer
Doctoral candidates will be offered a 4-year period of employment in principle, but in the form of 2 employment contracts. An initial 1,5 year contract with an official go/no go progress assessment within 15 months. Followed by an additional contract for the remaining 2,5 years assuming everything goes well and performance requirements are met. 

Salary and benefits are in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities, increasing from €2901 per month in the first year to €3707 in the fourth year. As a PhD candidate you will be enrolled in the TU Delft Graduate School. The TU Delft Graduate School provides an inspiring research environment with an excellent team of supervisors, academic staff and a mentor. The Doctoral Education Programme is aimed at developing your transferable, discipline-related and research skills. 

The TU Delft offers a customisable compensation package, discounts on health insurance, and a monthly work costs contribution. Flexible work schedules can be arranged.
