#### Are you passionate about AI, urban sustainability, and real-world impact? Join the "Clean Inner City" initiative as a postdoc and revolutionize urban waste management!

### Job description

The city of Amsterdam is actively developing new policies and pilot projects to transform how it manages urban waste. In collaboration with 
[AMS (Amsterdam Institute for Advanced Metropolitan Solutions)](https://www.ams-institute.org/), the city seeks innovative solutions to 
tackle the growing issue of waste and litter, particularly in its city center. To support this effort, the AMS Institute and the Municipality 
of Amsterdam have launched the “Clean Inner City” project to create, test, and evaluate advanced solutions for sustainable urban waste 
management. 

This postdoctoral position, funded under the "Clean Inner City" initiative, focuses on developing a smart sensing and monitoring system to 
better understand urban waste dynamics in Amsterdam. This includes but is not limited to, identifying entry processes of plastic (and other 
types of) waste into the environment from images, describing transport and retention processes in urban water systems, and exploring key 
explaining variables. The postdoc researcher will work on (1) collecting images at relevant study sites in Amsterdam, (2) designing and 
training AI-based models using deep learning, and (3) identifying and classifying the waste into different categories and exploring its 
transport dynamics in urban environments.

Key tasks of this postdoc position include:
- Developing a camera-based AI system to collect images at several field sites in Amsterdam.
- Collecting and curating image data (e.g., street-view images, hydrometeorological images) and potentially generating simulated datasets.
- Developing and training specialized deep learning models for waste-objects detection, classification of different waste types, and identifying waste patterns and actors contributing to these waste patterns.
- Collaborating with interdisciplinary teams and stakeholders to integrate the AI model into a real-world waste monitoring system. 

### Job requirements

You should have:
- a PhD degree (or can be expected in the coming months) in computer science, artificial intelligence, environmental science/engineering, civil engineering, geosciences, or a related discipline.
- passion to work on an emerging research topic with high societal relevance.
- interest and expertise in object detection from images and/or classification using deep learning, preferably with a strong publication record. Experience in plastic (or waste in general) detection or classification is a plus but not mandatory.
- affinity and motivation to plan and conduct (field) experiments in the Netherlands.
- demonstrated enthusiasm and proficiency in working with (complex) observational datasets.
- good command of English (oral and written).
- excellent programming (Python or/and C++), communication, and presentation skills.
- affinity with working in multi-disciplinary teams across institutes in an internationally oriented environment.
- enthusiasm and ability to publish research results in peer-reviewed academic journals/conferences.

### Research group(s)

The postdoc will be based in the [3D Geoinformation research group](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/) at [Delft University of Technology (TU Delft)](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/), 
and it is a joint position with the [River Plastic Team](https://plasticmonitoring.com/) of the [Hydrology and Environmental Hydraulics group (HWM)](https://www.wur.nl/en/research-results/chair-groups/environmental-sciences/hydrology-and-environmental-hydraulics-group.htm) 
at [Wageningen University & Research (WUR)](https://www.wur.nl/en.htm). The candidate will be supervised 
by Dr. [Liangliang Nan](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/liangliang/) (TU Delft), Dr. [Tim van Emmerik](https://www.wur.nl/nl/personen/tim-van-emmerik.htm) (WUR), 
and Prof. [Jantien Stoter](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/jstoter/) (TU Delft). You will be expected to spend 1-2 days per week at WUR and/or AMS, 
but this is open for discussion and may be subject to change depending on the project needs and the candidate’s interest.

The host research group, i.e., 3D Geoinformation research group, is part of the TU Delft. The group focuses on the technologies 
underpinning geographical data, and aims to design, develop, and implement open data and open-source solutions to model 3D cities, buildings, and 
landscapes in 3D for environmental and urban studies. It is a multidisciplinary group of around 25 people, including computer scientists, geomatics 
engineers, and geographers. It has a history of successful collaborations with the industry and the government: its research has led to [open-source 
software](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/code/), standards, and open data for the reconstruction, use, and management of 3D geographic information. 

Within WUR, your research will be embedded within the HWM group, where a lot of research is done on plastic transport in urban water systems, 
rivers, and estuaries. You will join the River Plastic Team, with around 9 other (PhD) researchers working on plastic pollution in aquatic 
environments. The HWM group has a strong (international) network with academic and societal partners that will benefit your research.

### Conditions of employment 

- Duration of contract is 2 years.
- Hours per week: 36 - 40.
- Salary range:  €3345 - €5278.
