## 3D Reconstruction and modelling of roofs in European cities 

# Teaser: Are you passionate about urban innovation, advanced 3D modeling, and impactful European research? Join the EU-funded "MultiRoofs" project, and shape the European cities’ skyline of tomorrow!

The overall goal of this fully-funded PhD position is to support the researchers and practitioners in the project "MultiRoofs" by designing and implementing algorithms for the 3D reconstruction of buildings and for the classification of roofs.


MultiRoofs (**Multi**functional **Roof**scapes for smart, green and just urban densification) is an EU-project that aims to enable public authorities to increase the multifunctional use of rooftops in their urban areas.
The project is composed of 25+ partners in Western Europe (including Rotterdam, Paris, Dublin, Brussels, companies, and universities) and it is an extension of a prototype developed in Rotterdam, the Netherlands ([see details](https://mvrdv.com/news/4290/mvrdv-launches-roofscape-a-new-software-to-help-reimagine-rotterdams-rooftops)).

The backbone of the current prototype is the [3DBAG](https://3dbag.nl), a dataset containing automatically reconstructed 3D models of all 10M+ buildings in the Netherlands; this dataset is (jointly) developed and maintained by our research group.

The tasks of the PhD candidate are:

* modify the [algorithms for the reconstruction of the 3D buildings](https://github.com/3DBAG/roofer) so that other source datasets can be used (aerial imagery, lidar with different densities, coarser footprints, etc.) to reconstruct 3D models of other European cities
* improve the algorithms to reconstruct [LoD3.0](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/lod/) models, ie dormers and chimneys and other objects relevant to roofs should be identified and modelled
* develop a solution for a better regularisation and symmetry of the dormers (one current weakness)
* work on workflows to (better) categorise the roofs for the different uses identified by the project partners.

The project will take place in the [3D geoinformation group at TU Delft](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl) under the supervision of [Dr Hugo Ledoux](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/hledoux) and [Prof. Jantien Stoter](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/jstoter)



## Research group

The position will be embedded in the [3D geoinformation research group](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl) at the [Delft University of Technology](https://tudelft.nl).


It focuses on the technologies underpinning geographical information systems (GIS) and aims at designing, developing, and implementing better systems to model 3D cities, buildings, and landscapes.


It is a multidisciplinary group (computer scientists, geomatics/mechanical/aerospace engineers, and geographers) composed of 8 permanent research staff, several PhD students, postdocs, and visitors.


It has a history of successful collaborations with the industry and the government: its research has led to [open source software](https://github.com/tudelft3d) and [open standards](https://www.cityjson.org) for the management of 3D geographic information.


We cover several aspects of 3D geoinformation: 3D reconstruction, analysis, CFD, energy

## Job requirements

We are looking for one highly motivated candidate who holds an MSc degree (or is almost completed) in geomatics/civil/aerospace/environmental engineering, geoinformatics, computer science, or in a related discipline. 

The candidate is expected to have:

* strong interest in computational geometry and 3D reconstruction
* experience with the management and analysis of 3D geo-data, 
* good programming skills (C++ being an advantage), 
* an affinity for working in multi‐disciplinary teams in an international oriented environment
* excellent oral and written communication skills (in English); see [requirements at TUDelft](https://www.tudelft.nl/onderwijs/opleidingen/phd/admission). 

The starting date is in consultation with the candidate, and we aim at 1 July 2024 at the latest.
