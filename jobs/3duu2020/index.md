## 3D understanding and modeling based on AI

We are seeking two highly-motivated PhD candidates to join the new [AI lab on 3D Urban Understanding (3DUU)](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/ai/ai-labs/3duu/) initiated by the [3D Geoinformation Research Group](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/) and the [Intelligent Vehicles Group](http://intelligent-vehicles.org/) under the TU Delft's AI, Data and Digitalisation research and education program ([DAI-Labs](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/ai/research/ai-labs-talent-recruitment/)). 3DUU is a new cross-disciplinary research lab seeking to develop state-of-the-art AI techniques for interpreting 3D data and reconstructing 3D objects for large-scale urban applications. 

Each position has roles in both research and education:

1) **Research**. Prospective PhDs will be working on solving exciting and challenging 3D modeling problems by developing and applying AI technologies. Specifically, the project aims at developing robust and efficient AI-based methods to automatically identify, analyze, process, and model complex 3D objects (e.g., buildings, trees) in the urban environment. Apart from these two PhD positions, there will be two other PhDs in the same lab and with whom you will be working together. Those other two will be hired on closely-related research topics with an emphasis on autonomous driving. 

2) **Education**. An important aim of the DAI-Labs is to increase the capacity and quality of AI education at TU Delft. The PhDs will be offered an extra year (in contrast with the normal 4-year PhD program at TU Delft) to contribute to the education of AI (e.g., helping to teach and prepare new courses). 


The two PhD positions will take place in the [3D Geoinformation Research Group](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl) at TU Delft under the supervision of assistant professor [Liangliang Nan](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/liangliang/), and associate professor [Hugo Ledoux](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/hledoux) or professor [Jantien Stoter](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/jstoter/). 


## Job requirements
<!-- 600 char --> 

A candidate must have

 - an MSc degree (or can be expected in the coming months) in computer science, applied mathematics, or in a related discipline;
 - strong interests and expertise in machine learning (in particular deep learning), 3D modeling and/or geometry processing, preferably with a strong publication record;
 - excellent C++ and/or Python programming skills;
 - good command of English (oral and written).


## Research group

The host research group, i.e., [3D Geoinformation Research Group](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl), is part of the [Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/architecture-and-the-built-environment/) at [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/) and focuses on the technologies underpinning geographical information systems (GIS), and aims at designing, developing, and implementing better systems to model 3D cities, buildings, and landscapes. It is a multidisciplinary group of around [20 people](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/about/#people), including computer scientists, geomatics engineers, and geographers. It has a history of successful collaborations with the industry and the government: its research has led to [open source software](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/code/), standards, and patents for the management of 3D geographic information.


## Doing a PhD at TU Delft

TU Delft offers [DAI-Lab](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/ai/research/ai-labs-talent-recruitment/) PhD candidates a 5-year contract (as opposed to the normal 4-years), with an official go/no go progress assessment after one year. Salary and benefits are in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities, increasing from € 2325 per month in the first year to € 3123 in the fifth year. As a PhD candidate, you will be enrolled in the TU Delft Graduate School. The TU Delft Graduate School provides an inspiring research environment with an excellent team of supervisors, academic staff, and a mentor. The Doctoral Education Programme is aimed at developing your transferable, discipline-related research skills. The TU Delft offers a customizable compensation package, discounts on health insurance and sport memberships, and a monthly work cost contribution. For international applicants, we offer the Coming to Delft Service and Partner Career Advice to assist you with your relocation.
