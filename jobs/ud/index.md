## Description of the position

The [3D geoinformation research group](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl) would like to consolidate and extend its research by adding an additional knowledge domain to its research: 3D object reconstruction for urban applications.
The research of the group has so far focused on data modelling, data structures, and dissemination of data in the context of urban applications; both outdoor (e.g. the modelling of buildings and the terrain) and indoor applications are equally important. The applications cover for instance noise and air quality simulations, energy and safety applications, as well as indoor navigation applications for disaster management.
With this new position we would like to cover the whole 3D geoinformation chain: from 3D data acquisition to the use of 3D data in decision making. 
We expect the new assistant professor to actively collaborate with the current staff and strengthen our research.
 
The task of the assistant professor is to start and lead this new research theme in the domain of automatic 3D object reconstruction for urban applications; this should ideally be for both indoors and outdoors.
The 3D input data may come from different sources: laser scanning or images, from terrestrial or airborne platforms, manned or unmanned (drones), etc.
The candidate will also have to teach in the [MSc Geomatics programme](http://geomatics.tudelft.nl), and potentially develop new courses related to his/her area of research.

The expected starting date is 1 January 2017, or as soon as possible.


## Research group

The [3D geoinformation research group](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl), part of the [Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment](http://www.bk.tudelft.nl/en) at the [Delft University of Technology](http://www.tudelft.nl), focuses on the technologies underpinning geographical information systems (GIS), and aims at designing, developing and implementing better systems to model 3D cities, buildings and landscapes.
It is a multidisciplinary group of around [15 people](/about/), including computer scientists, geomatics engineers, and geographers; 3 of them are tenured staff (1 professor, 1 associate-professor and 1 assistant-professor).
It has a history of successful collaborations with the industry and the government: its research has led to [software](https://github.com/tudelft3d), standards and patents for the management of 3D geographic information.


## Job requirements
<!-- 600 char --> 

The candidate should:

  - hold a PhD degree in a field related to 3D reconstruction (geoinformation, computational geometry, geomatics, or a comparable subject) 
  - have ample experience and knowledge in 3D data reconstruction
  - have excellent scientific skills, as demonstrated by a peer-reviewed publications
  - have an affinity for applying research results to real-world problems; the ability to develop prototypes and software is an advantage
  - have prior experience in supervision of PhD and MSc students
  - have proven didactic skills and teaching experience, since the candidate will have to teach (in English) in the [MSc Geomatics programme](http://geomatics.tudelft.nl)


## What we offer

A tenure-track position is offered for six years. 
Based on performance indicators agreed upon at the start of the appointment, a decision will be made by the fifth year whether to offer you a permanent faculty position.
During the tenure track, you will have the opportunity to develop into an internationally acknowledged and recognised academic. 

We offer a structured career and [personal development programme](http://www.tudelft.nl/tenuretrack) designed to offer individual academics as much support as possible. 
More information about the tenure track is available [there](https://intranet.tudelft.nl/en/human-resources/themes/employment/appointment-types/tenure-trackers/).

The salary and the benefits are in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities.
For this position, the salary is between €3427 and €4691 per month (based on full-time employment), depending on experience and knowledge.

TU Delft offers a customisable compensation package, a discount for health insurance and sport memberships, and a monthly work costs contribution. 
Flexible work schedules can be arranged. 
An International Children’s Centre offers childcare and an international primary school. 
Dual Career Services offers support to accompanying partners. 

If the candidate has less than five years of teaching experience and do not yet have a teaching certificate, we allow you up to three years to obtain it.
