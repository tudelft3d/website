## Automation of urban flow simulations with 3D City Models

The way we shape our cities can affect the levels of pedestrian wind, pollution dispersion, and heat exposure. 
Thanks to the growing computational resources and the advancements in automatic reconstruction of 3D city models, Computational Fluid Dynamics models (CFD) are often used to analyse the wind environment within rapidly changing urban environments. 
However, when performing CFD simulations, it is estimated that practitioners still spend large part of their time in reconstructing, through a semi-manual process, the input for the simulations (which include the generation of an appropriate 3D model and CFD mesh designs). 

The overall goal of this fully-funded PhD position is to develop a framework to automatically construct CFD simulations inputs at different levels-of-detail (to support CFD at different urban scales) and ensure that these can be directly used in an urban simulation software. 
The project will focus on the link between the automatic creation of 3D city models and their usability in open-source CFD libraries, specifically [OpenFOAM](https://openfoam.com). 
The PhD will have to identify critical bottlenecks that slow down this connection, and develop open-source tools to generate the appropriate CFD inputs with minimal manual interaction.

The PhD candidate will use and modify open source software in development within the 3D geoinformation group, in particular the software [3dfier](https://github.com/tudelft3d/3dfier) for geometry reconstruction and OpenFOAM libraries for the urban simulations. 
These models should serve as input for performing predictions of wind, temperature, and dispersion in evolving cities. 
Low and high-fidelity fluid dynamic simulations are envisioned within the research, as well as the postprocessing of local wind and temperature measurements acquired in urban experimental campaigns.

The project will take place in the 3D geoinformation group under the supervision of [Dr Clara García-Sánchez](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/gsclara/) and [Dr Hugo Ledoux](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/hledoux).


## Research group

The [3D geoinformation research group](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl), part of the [Faculty of the Built Environment and Architecture](http://www.bk.tudelft.nl/en) at the [Delft University of Technology](http://www.tudelft.nl), focuses on the technologies underpinning geographical information systems (GIS), and aims at designing, developing, and implementing better systems to model 3D cities, buildings and landscapes.
It is a multidisciplinary group of around [20 people](/about/), including computer scientists, geomatics engineers, and geographers; 5 of them are tenured staff (1 professor, 1 associate-professor, and 3 assistant-professor).
It has a history of successful collaborations with the industry and the government: its research has led to [open source](https://github.com/tudelft3d) [software](https://github.com/tudelft3d), standards, and patents for the management of 3D geographic information.



## Job requirements
<!-- 600 char --> 

We are looking for highly motivated candidates that hold an MSc degree (or almost completed) in aerospace engineering, civil and environmental engineering, geoinformatics/geomatics, computer science or in a related discipline.
