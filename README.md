# Website

![jekyll build](https://github.com/tudelft3d/website/workflows/jekyll%20build/badge.svg)


Website for the [3D geoinformation group](http://3dgeoinfo.bk.tudelft.nl) at [TU Delft](http://www.tudelft.nl). Uses [Jekyll](http://www.jekyllrb.com) to generate static pages.

If you change something, push it to the repository. The website will be updated after ~5 minutes. If you need to update the website manually, ask around for the *secret* update script.


## References

The first author of a paper should put the paper in the `all.bib` file in the `pubs/` folder. 

The BibTeX key should be in the form AuthorYYa, e.g. `Ledoux14a` and `Ledoux14b`. 

The following fields can be used:

  * DOI: put the full URL with http://dx.doi.org/…
  * PDF: give the link to a PDF with full URL (http://…). You can place the PDF in `/var/www/pdfs/` (so the URL should be `http://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/pfds/Ledoux14a.pdf`). Do *not* put the PDFs in the repository.
  * URL: an external link to related info, e.g. website for the paper, code, etc.
  * Presentation: slides for an accompanying presentation

For professional publications (such as GIM International) please use `@misc`. 


## Code, projects, homepage images, etc.

Add the details of a new project/code/staff in `_data/` in the YAML (.yml) file. The related images should go in the appropriate folder in `img/`. Pages will be generated automatically from these.


## Adding blog/news posts

Each blog/news post is a [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) file in `_posts`. When creating one, just copy the structure of the other ones, the naming convention for the files must be followed and each file should have a header of this form:

```
---
layout: post
title:  "Testing..1..2..testing"
categories: news
date:   2015-09-29 08:29
author: John Smith
---
```

To write markdown and see right-away the result, use that very handy [website](http://dillinger.io). 

To add images, you must them in the folder `/img/2015/myimg.jpg` and then add them with 

```
Bla bla bla 

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/2015/myimg.jpg)
```
