[Random3Dcity](https://github.com/tudelft3d/Random3Dcity) is a basic and experimental procedural modelling engine that is focused on constructing buildings in multiple LODs and in CityGML.

A sample dataset (CityGML and OBJ) containing 900 buildings in multiple LODs can be obtained from [here](https://filipbiljecki.com/code/Random3Dcity.html).

### Paper and attribution

The methodology is described in the paper below.
