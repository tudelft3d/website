I"û<p>On Monday 1 May 2017, <a href="https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/biljecki/">Filip Biljecki</a> successfully defended his PhD thesis at TU Delft.
Because both his work in the last 4.5 years and his thesis were judged â€œexceptionalâ€, he also graduated <em>cum laude</em>, which is awarded to less than 5% of PhD theses in the Netherlands.</p>

<p>Filipâ€™s PhD thesis is entitled <em>Level of detail in 3D city models</em> (<a href="http://doi.org/b463">PDF freely available</a>).</p>

<p>Congratulations Dr Biljecki ğŸ‰</p>
